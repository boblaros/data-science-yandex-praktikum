# Farm Data Analysis

Within this project, two machine learning models will be developed for the dairy farm "Voliy Lug" to enhance risk management in purchasing new cows.

**Goal**: Create two predictive ML models based on cow data to predict a) possible milk yield and b) the probability of delicious milk from cows.

Work Plan:

- Project Overview
- Data Description
- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Linear Regression Model Training
- Logistic Regression Model Training
- Conclusion

Data is provided by dairy farm "Voliy Lug".

## Conclusion

The project delves into analyzing data from the dairy farm "Volny Lug" to predict milk yield and milk taste quality for prospective cows, highlighting non-normal distributions in most features, breed and grazing distributions, and correlations among input features. The linear regression model achieved an RÂ² of 0.814, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting milk yield, while the logistic regression model prioritized minimizing false negatives in assessing milk taste quality.
