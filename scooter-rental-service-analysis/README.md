# Scooter Rental Service Analysis

This study analyzes user data from the **GoFast scooter rental service** across several cities, focusing on users and their trips.

**Objective**: Analyze GoFast data and test hypotheses aimed at improving the service and identifying growth opportunities.

## Hypotheses

1. Do users with a subscription spend more time on trips? If so, subscription users might be more "profitable" for the company.
2. The optimal trip distance to minimize scooter wear and tear is 3130 meters. Can we conclude that the average distance traveled by subscription users per trip does not exceed 3130 meters?
3. Will the monthly revenue from subscription users be higher than the revenue from non-subscription users?
4. What is the minimum number of promo codes that need to be sent out to ensure there's only a 5% chance of not meeting the promo code distribution plan?

## Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed user data from the GoFast scooter rental service across several cities, focusing on users and their trips to identify growth opportunities. The key findings are as follows:

- **Subscription Users**: Users with a subscription spend more time on trips, making them potentially more profitable for GoFast. This is supported by the fact that monthly revenue from subscription users is higher than that from non-subscription users. Therefore, increasing the number of subscription users is a growth opportunity. Currently, only 45.6% of users (699) have a paid subscription.
- **Trip Distance**: The average trip distance for subscription users generally does not exceed 3130 meters, indicating that scooters wear out at an optimal rate.

## Additional Insights

- The majority of users are aged between 20-30 years.
- The average trip duration is 17-18 minutes.
