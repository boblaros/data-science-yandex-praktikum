# Moscow vs. Saint Petersburg: Music Preferences Analysis

## Overview

**Comparison between Moscow and Saint Petersburg** has always been surrounded by myths. For instance:

- **Moscow** is a bustling metropolis driven by a relentless workweek.
- **Saint Petersburg** is the cultural capital with its distinct tastes.

Using data from **Yandex Music**, I delve into the musical behaviors of users from these two iconic cities.

## Research Objectives

My study aims to test three hypotheses:

1. **User activity varies by day of the week**, and this variation is different between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
2. **Music genres favored on Monday mornings and Friday evenings** differ between the two cities.
3. **Musical preferences diverge**, with pop music being more popular in Moscow and Russian rap more frequent in Saint Petersburg.

## Methodology

The dataset, `yandex_music_project.csv`, contains user behavior information. The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Review:** I begin with an initial examination of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** I identified and corrected critical data errors to ensure the quality of the analysis.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** I conducted thorough tests to validate the hypotheses.

## Conclusion

My project explores the musical differences between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, focusing on user activity and weekly preferences. Moscow peaks on Mondays and Fridays, while Saint Petersburg shows highest activity on Wednesdays. Weekly musical tastes vary slightly: Moscow prefers "world" music on Mondays, while Saint Petersburg leans towards jazz and classical.
