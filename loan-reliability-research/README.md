# Loan Reliability Research

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether a client's marital status and number of children affect their likelihood of repaying a loan on time. The research is based on customer payment behavior statistics. The results may be used to develop a credit scoring model to assess potential borrowers' ability to repay loans.

## Research Goal

Determine if there is an impact of marital status and the number of children on the probability of timely loan repayment.

## Key Findings

1. **Children and Debt**: The proportion of debtors increases with the number of children (applicable to families with 0, 1, and 2 children).
2. **Marital Status and Debt**: Those who have been married have a lower proportion of debtors compared to those currently married. The highest proportion of debtors is among those who have never been married.
3. **Income and Debt**: Among people with high incomes (up to one million rubles per month), the proportion of overdue loans decreases as income increases.
4. **Loan Purpose**: Real estate transactions are the most reliable loan purposes, while car loans and education loans are the most risky.
