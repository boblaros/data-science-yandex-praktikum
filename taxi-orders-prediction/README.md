# Taxi Order Prediction Project

**Client**: "Chotenkoye Taxi"

**Data**: Historical data on taxi orders at airports

**Client Request**: Attract more drivers during peak load times

**Project Goal**: Develop a machine learning model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour

**Model Quality Criterion**: The RMSE metric value on the test set should be no more than 48

## Conclusion

In this project, we aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict taxi orders for the next hour using historical data from "Chotenkoye Taxi." The model helps attract more drivers during peak times. The model was evaluated with an RMSE metric, achieving a value below 48 on the test set, meeting the client's quality criterion.
