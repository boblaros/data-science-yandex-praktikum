# Steel Temperature Prediction

## Client
Metallurgical Plant "Steel Bird"

## Business Problem
Reduce electricity consumption during the steel processing stage by controlling the alloy temperature.

## Project Goal
Develop a machine learning model to predict alloy temperature.

## Conclusion

We analyzed data from the Steel Bird metallurgical plant to develop a machine learning model for predicting alloy temperature to reduce electricity consumption during steel processing. The data included electrodes, alloy temperature, and additives. After preprocessing and feature engineering, we trained three models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost). The CatBoost Regressor was the best, achieving an MAE of 6.28.
